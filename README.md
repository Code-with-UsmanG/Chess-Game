# **Chess Game (C++)**  

### **Overview**  
This is a **CLI-based Chess game** developed as part of my **1st-semester** *Programming Fundamentals* course project. Written entirely in **C++**, it follows all standard chess rules, including **legal moves, check/checkmate detection, and turn-based gameplay**.  

With **nearly 7,000 lines of code**, this project was a deep dive into **logic building, problem-solving, and structured programming**.  

### **Features**  
✔️ **Fully functional Chess gameplay**  
✔️ **Turn-based system for two players**  
✔️ **Valid move enforcement based on chess rules**  
✔️ **Pawn Promotion**  
✔️ **Console-based UI with a clear board representation**  
✔️ **Game state saving and loading using File Handling**

### **Technologies Used**  
- **C++**  
- **Programming Fundamentals** (Arrays, Pointers, Methods)  
- **File Handling** (For saving/loading game state)    

### **Installation & Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:
